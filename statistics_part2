**1. What is hypothesis testing in statistics?**
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or inferences about population parameters based on sample data. It helps determine whether there is enough evidence to reject a given assumption (hypothesis) about a population.

---

**2. What is the null hypothesis, and how does it differ from the alternative hypothesis?**
The **null hypothesis (H₀)** is a statement that there is no effect or no difference; it represents the default or status quo.
The **alternative hypothesis (H₁ or Ha)** is a statement that indicates the presence of an effect or difference.
The goal of hypothesis testing is often to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

---

**3. What is the significance level in hypothesis testing, and why is it important?**
The **significance level (α)** is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Common values are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10.
It is important because it defines the threshold for deciding whether a result is statistically significant.

---

**4. What does a P-value represent in hypothesis testing?**
The **P-value** is the probability of observing the test results, or more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It helps measure the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.

---

**5. How do you interpret the P-value in hypothesis testing?**

* If **P-value ≤ α**: Reject the null hypothesis (evidence is statistically significant).
* If **P-value > α**: Do not reject the null hypothesis (not enough evidence).

---

**6. What are Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing?**

* **Type 1 error (α):** Rejecting a true null hypothesis (false positive).
* **Type 2 error (β):** Failing to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative).

---

**7. What is the difference between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test in hypothesis testing?**

* **One-tailed test:** Tests for an effect in one direction only (e.g., H₁: μ > μ₀).
* **Two-tailed test:** Tests for an effect in both directions (e.g., H₁: μ ≠ μ₀).

---

**8. What is the Z-test, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?**
A **Z-test** is used when the population variance is known, and the sample size is large (n ≥ 30). It compares the sample mean to a known population mean using the standard normal distribution.

---

**9. How do you calculate the Z-score, and what does it represent in hypothesis testing?**

$$
Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}
$$

Where:

* $\bar{X}$ = sample mean
* $\mu$ = population mean
* $\sigma$ = population standard deviation
* $n$ = sample size
  The Z-score shows how many standard deviations the sample mean is from the population mean.

---

**10. What is the T-distribution, and when should it be used instead of the normal distribution?**
The **T-distribution** is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small (n < 30). It accounts for the extra uncertainty in the estimate of variability.

---

**11. What is the difference between a Z-test and a T-test?**

* **Z-test**: Known population standard deviation, large sample size.
* **T-test**: Unknown population standard deviation, small sample size.

---

**12. What is the T-test, and how is it used in hypothesis testing?**
A **T-test** compares sample means to a population mean or between two groups to determine if there is a significant difference. It is used when the standard deviation is unknown.

---

**13. What is the relationship between Z-test and T-test in hypothesis testing?**
Both tests compare sample data to a population hypothesis, but the **T-test** adjusts for smaller sample sizes and unknown standard deviations. As sample size increases, the T-distribution approaches the Z-distribution.

---

**14. What is a confidence interval, and how is it used to interpret statistical results?**
A **confidence interval (CI)** gives a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie, with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%). It helps estimate parameters and assess uncertainty.

---

**15. What is the margin of error, and how does it affect the confidence interval?**
The **margin of error** is the amount added and subtracted from the sample estimate to create the confidence interval. A larger margin of error means a wider interval and more uncertainty.

---

**16. How is Bayes' Theorem used in statistics, and what is its significance?**
**Bayes' Theorem** calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge. It updates beliefs with new evidence and is fundamental in **Bayesian statistics**.
Formula:

$$
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

---

**17. What is the Chi-square distribution, and when is it used?**
The **Chi-square distribution** is used in tests of independence and goodness of fit. It is applied to categorical data and compares observed and expected frequencies.

---

**18. What is the Chi-square goodness of fit test, and how is it applied?**
This test checks if a sample matches a population with a known distribution.

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

Where $O_i$ = observed frequency, $E_i$ = expected frequency.

---

**19. What is the F-distribution, and when is it used in hypothesis testing?**
The **F-distribution** is used to compare variances between two populations. It is the basis for the ANOVA test and the F-test.

---

**20. What is an ANOVA test, and what are its assumptions?**
**ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** tests whether there are significant differences among three or more group means.
**Assumptions**:

* Independence of observations
* Normality
* Equal variances (homogeneity of variance)

---

**21. What are the different types of ANOVA tests?**

* **One-way ANOVA**: One independent variable
* **Two-way ANOVA**: Two independent variables
* **Repeated Measures ANOVA**: Same subjects measured multiple times

---

**22. What is the F-test, and how does it relate to hypothesis testing?**
An **F-test** compares two variances to determine if they are significantly different. It is commonly used in ANOVA to assess overall group differences.
